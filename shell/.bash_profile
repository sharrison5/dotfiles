#Â .bash_profile is read if the login shell is bash. It therefore has two
# main roles:
#  + Source any global settings from .profile
#  + If the shell is interactive, source .bashrc

# Note that we try and minimise what we place in this file, as it may not
# be sourced at all! For example, on Ubuntu the default login shell is dash.
# That means .bash_profile cannot safely be sourced by e.g. Gnome, and we also
# shouldn't source it from .bashrc (see .profile for an explanation of the
# different roles these files have).
